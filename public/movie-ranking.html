<h1>Matt's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3><i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy</h3>
<p>These films are by no means perfect, and I disagree with some of the changes from the novels. But Peter Jackson redefined what is considered possible in films with these; I don't think something with this scope will be produced again in my lifetime.</p>
<h3><i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i></h3>
<p>This film introduced me to new ways of being, and redefined what it is to be queer. The musical is also one of my favorite of all time.</p>
<h3><i>The Devil Wears Prada</i></h3>
<p>Meryl Streep is sublime as Miranda Priestly. I want to be her.
<h3><i>Death Becomes Her</i></h3>
<p>So camp. So much fun. Another favorite of mine for Meryl Streep.</p>
